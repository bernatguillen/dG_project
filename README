Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods, APC523 project
================================

This is the project for course APC523, I will implement discontinuous nodal Galerkin methods for several problems (for now 1-D advection, maxwell equations).

Files
===========
mesh1d.cc: Includes all the methods required to declare an element of the class dG1D_Framework. Generates a uniform grid in 1D. Creates the Gauss-Lobatto points, Gauss-Jacobi polynomials, Vandermonde matrix, D_r, face connectivity matrix, etc.

d1Advection.cc: First example, linear advection with initial condition sin(x) and boundary condition (sin(2pit),---)
d1discont.cc: Second example, linear advection with initial condition a step function and periodical boundary conditions
d1Maxwell.cc: Third example, Maxwell 1D equations
unittest.cc: Unit tests for mesh1d.cc

mesh2d.cc: Not working yet

Makefile: Generates the executables. Call make all to create Adv_1D, Adv_Disc, Maxwell_1D and unittest. Requires GSL (GNU Scientific Library) to work.
